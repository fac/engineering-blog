  Graeme variously refers to himself as a software engineer, software craftsman, systems administrator or entrepreneur depending upon his mood. Before joining the team, he spent 4 years running his own business, using FreeAgent to manage the books, so he likes to think he knows a thing or two about the product from a user's perspective.
