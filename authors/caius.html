<p>
  Caius is an operations engineer at FreeAgent, although he also counts artisan silly-gif artist, rabbit-hole spelunker and full time yak-shaver as part of his role. (There's also a rumour he accidentally made it a requirement for <a href="https://twitter.com/freeagent/status/545961663698960386">remote colleagues to work wearing onesies</a>.)
</p>

<p>
  He also likes to dump thoughts on the internet <small><strike>140</strike></small> 280 characters at a time as <a href="https://twitter.com/caius">@caius</a> and rarely updates his personal blog at <a href="http://caiustheory.com/">CaiusTheory</a>.
