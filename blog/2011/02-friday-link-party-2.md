What we've been reading about this week:

-   [New Relic](http://newrelic.com) regularly release statistics about
    the apps they're monitoring. The latest [State of the
    Stack](http://blog.newrelic.com/2011/09/28/state-of-the-stack-a-ruby-on-rails-benchmarking-report-sept-2011/)
    makes for interesting reading as usual. It shows that Ruby 1.9.2 is
    fast catching up with 1.8.7 and Rails 3.0 is the most popular Rails
    version. [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/) and
    [Passenger](http://www.modrails.com/) are still by far the most
    popular dispatchers. If you're interested, FreeAgent is currently
    running on Ruby 1.9.2-p180 and Rails 3.0.10 We're currently running
    Apache and Passenger but will be moving over to
    [nginx](http://nginx.net/) and
    [Unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) in the coming weeks.
-   [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/). We writing more and
    more Javascript these days and we're finding Jasmine is a lovely way
    to unit test this code.
-   We read about [How Etsy Overcame Poor Architectural
    Choices](http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2011/10/when-clever-goes-wrong-how-etsy-overcame-poor-architectural-choices.ars)
-   The RubyConf 2011 videos [have started to appear on
    confreaks.net](http://confreaks.net/events/rubyconf2011)
-   We discovered [everything you ever wanted to know about web
    performance but were afraid to
    ask](http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2010/06/15/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-web-performance/).
    Fast apps == Happy customers.
-   [Browser Stack](http://www.browserstack.com/) has come out of beta
-   [d3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) is a jQuery-like data
    visualisation library that looks really useful

Until next time, ciao!
