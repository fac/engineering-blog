What we've been [Instapapering](http://www.instapaper.com/) this week:

-   We do a lot of testing at FreeAgent, for good reason. We also do
    peer reviews of code so [Why code review beats testing: evidence
    from decades of programming
    research](http://kev.inburke.com/kevin/the-best-ways-to-find-bugs-in-your-code/)
    was an encouraging read.
<% end %>
-   Robert X Cringely's column is always worth reading. Recently he
    wrote about [The Second Coming of
    Java](http://www.cringely.com/2011/10/the-second-coming-of-java/),
    in which he asks if database servers switch to SSDs and disk I/O
    latency is a thing of the past, whether the better performance of
    Java over Ruby (or other interpreted languages such as Python) will
    result in a mass movement back to Java. What do you think?
-   The new [draft RFC for new HTTP status
    codes](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-new-status-02)
    is interesting, with new codes for rate limiting and conditional
    requests.
-   FogCreek released [a new web app called Trello](http://trello.com)
    recently. It's a project collaboration tool and we've started using
    it at FreeAgent for managing our QA pipeline to great effect.
-   Anyone planning to go to [Railsberry](http://railsberry.com/) next
    year?

Adios amigos!
