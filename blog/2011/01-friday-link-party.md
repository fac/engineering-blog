There’s a whole lot of talk in our Campfire dev chat room all week, and
quite a few links get thrown in there. It’s hard to keep up sometimes,
so I’ve decided to start collating them for posterity and to share with
our developer community each week.

So here are the main things we’ve been reading about this week:

-   [Moneta](https://github.com/wycats/moneta) is a library by [Yehuda
    Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/) that provides a single interface for
    interacting with a variety of key-value stores. Neat.
-   The [FogCreek](http://fogcreek.com) team have been blogging about
    [Developer
    Happiness](http://blog.fogcreek.com/the-price-of-dev-happiness-part-two/).
    The latest post describes their *$10,000 coffee machine*. Cue lots
    of love for [Rancilio
    products](http://www.rancilio.com/rancilio/prodotti.jsp?id_language=3).
    Some FreeAgents take their coffee *very* seriously!
-   [Intolerant](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Intolerant) is a language
    “that wipes the user’s hard drive if an error occurs”. Not something
    I’m planning on introducing to FreeAgent but I guess it’s one way of
    making sure engineers are [writing solid
    code](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WritingSolidCode).
-   If you’re that way inclined you can [get the OS X desktop on your
    iPhone](http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/19/lion-ultimatum-brings-desktop-like-functionality-and-file-manage/).
    Why would you do this?!
-   We read this article about [why developers never use state
    machines](http://www.skorks.com/2011/09/why-developers-never-use-state-machines/)
    and were in generally agreement that state machines are brilliant
    and people should use them all the time. We use the
    [`state_machine`](https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine) gem
    in FreeAgent.
-   [nyan.cat](http://nyan.cat/). Sorry :-)

Have a nice weekend!
