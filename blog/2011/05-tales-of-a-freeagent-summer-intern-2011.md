Hi all! I’m one of this year’s summer engineering interns at FreeAgent
and I would like to introduce myself, give you an overview of what it’s
like working for FreeAgent, and finally share a few of my work
experiences with you. First though, a little about myself: I’m a 4<sup>th</sup>
year student at the University of Edinburgh, studying [Software
Engineering and Artificial
Intelligence](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/undergraduate/aise.html). My main
interests include rock-climbing, snowboarding, and of course software
development! 

The main feature I’ve been working on this summer is the
second generation of FreeAgent’s
[RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)
API, which broadens the scope of the API as well as making it more
developer-friendly. Working in a small, dedicated team has enabled me to
use my skills productively, whilst also providing the opportunity for me
to learn from some really talented people in the Ruby/Rails field.

FreeAgent has proven to be a challenging work environment -- the team
are passionate about the product and expect a high standard of code --
but one which encourages innovation. As an example, while working on the
new API, I had to dig through the various versions of the [OAuth
protocol](http://oauth.net/), and make a decision with the team about
whether we adopt version 1.0a or take a more risky approach and use the
new 2.0 version, which is still in beta. 

Until now, I have always
automatically chosen the most recent version of libraries/plugins and
coped with the consequences when they arose (which they always do!).
When completing assignments for university, this habit has quite
frequently resulted in me having to learn a whole new language! In the
end, despite it not being the 'safe option', we decided OAuth 2.0 was
the best option for us for the new API (WIN!), but this was only after
we'd discussed the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. An
important lesson I learned from this situation was that any option may
be possible as long as you have well thought out reasoning for your
actions. 

Working for FreeAgent hasn't meant I've spent my days just
writing code (or making coffee!). A typical working day might include a
few of the following:

-   Morning: The development team stand-up meeting, where every
    developer shares what they are working on, and what they have
    planned for the day ahead.
-   Noon: We eat lunch (provided *free* at least once a week!) together,
    discuss exciting new technologies and perhaps watch a tech talk on
    the big screen.
-   Evening: Go out for a drink (or two!), a bite to eat and maybe a
    team visit to a tourist attraction or festival show in the beautiful
    city of Edinburgh.

A few weeks from now, my journey as an intern will come to an end and I
shall return to my final year of university with new skills, a more
logical approach to problems, hands on work experience, and a bunch of
new drinking buddies! If you would like to follow in my footsteps with
this amazing experience, FreeAgent are always looking for new talent and
interns during the summer months, so [don’t hesitate to
apply](mailto:jobs@freeagentcentral.com)!
