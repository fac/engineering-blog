Thomas Haggett, one of our senior platform engineers, recently gave a
talk at a [Scottish Ruby User Group](http://scotrug.org) meetup about
[Puppet](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet) and
[MCollective](http://puppetlabs.com/mcollective/introduction/), two
technologies we've been embracing in anger at FreeAgent in 2011. We'll
be blogging about what we're doing with these technologies in detail in
the coming months but in the meantime, here's a little taster video:
