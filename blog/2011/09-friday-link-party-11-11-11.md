Totally forgot to post here last week so this week it's a special,
bumper, 'rollover' edition of link goodness. Here we go...

-   We're hard at work putting the finishing touches to our [second
    generation
    API](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/freeagent_api/_xf-4Kz9esg/kbh1rAb9x7EJ)
    right now. The new API uses OAuth as opposed to HTTP Basic for
    authentication, so
    [OAuthPlayground](https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/) popped
    up at just the right time.
-   In the [latest Clean Coders
    episode](http://www.cleancoders.com/codecast/clean-code-episode-7/show),
    ['uncle' Bob Martin](https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin) talks about
    the architecture of "web-based accounting systems"!
-   Nicholas Henry published an article on the Firsthand Web Design blog
    called [Rails is not your
    application](http://blog.firsthand.ca/2011/10/rails-is-not-your-application.html).
-   The [2012 Turing Lecture](http://www.bcs.org/category/16216) will be
    coming to our home town of Edinburgh.
-   We don't use [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) right now at FreeAgent
    but if it's something you're interested in, [The Node Beginner
    Book](http://www.nodebeginner.org/) looks like a great place to
    start.
-   Do we need another browser? The people at [Raven](http://raven.io/)
    certainly think so. Anyone used this yet?
-   We're big fans of AWS here at FreeAgent (we use S3 in production and
    we've been playing around with EC2). Amazon have expanded their
    regions with [a new one in Oregon,
    USA](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/11/now-open-us-west-portland-region.html).
-   If you find yourself unable to keep on top of your gems in your Ruby
    app and you want someone to just tell you when new versions are
    available, maybe [Gemnasium](https://gemnasium.com/) is for you.
-   If you're using plain MD5 hashes for passwords, take a look at
    [BozoCrack](https://github.com/juuso/BozoCrack) to see how secure
    they are.
-   Finally, we reminisced about the good old days of writing [Hungarian
    Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation%20), that
    *[tactical nuclear weapon of source code obfuscation
    technique](http://thc.org/root/phun/unmaintain.html)*. I
    particularly like the [MSDN
    guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa260976(v=vs.60).aspx)
    examples: 

  `int* pbsy = &rgbsyHash[(wHash&077777)%cwHash];`

And on that note... laters.
