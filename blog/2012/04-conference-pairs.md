At FreeAgent we strive to create the best working environment we can for
our Engineering team.

A happy employee is a productive employee and, as an engineer myself, I
understand that there's little that makes us happier than fast
interwebs, great coffee (or tea, served from a teapot, naturally), free
beer (or [Irn Bru](http://www.irn-bru.co.uk/)), shiny new toys and an
endless supply of challenging code to craft. This is why we use
[Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org), buy [Herman Miller
chairs](http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/work-chairs/aeron-chairs.html),
top-of-the-line [Apple](http://www.apple.com/imac/performance.html)
[gear](http://www.apple.com/uk/macbookair/performance.html) and have
ended up with an amazing office full of brilliant people. 

In the
'enterprise world' it's called Investing in People, but it's full name
is actually Investing in Shiny Stuff for Nice Peopleâ„¢. 

Which leads me
onto the subject of conferences. 

Today's tech conferences are fun,
sociable, held in hip cities across the globe and have genuinely useful
content presented by engaging, inspiring people. This is especially true
for the Ruby community, which has a wealth of conferences to choose
from. It's very hard to attend one of these conferences and not come
back inspired by your craft and the people involved in the community.

Yet despite this, it can often be difficult to convince one's boss that
it's worth shelling out a grand to fly staff on a jolly to Barcelona for
the weekend for two days of presentations and parties. Funny that. 

But
we don't think this way. It's crucial to us that our engineers feel
inspired by their craft, and we recognise that attending (not to mention
speaking at) conferences is an important way to get inspiration for your
work, to socialise with engineers from other like-minded companies and
get to feel part of a real community, a movement. We also don't want our
engineers to feel in any way lonely in another city either, so we always
try and make sure we send people in pairs (or more!). I'm convinced this
is money well spent. 

So if you're involved in the Ruby or Web community,
here are the conferences you'll find some FreeAgents at in the coming
months:

-   [Nordic Ruby](http://nordicruby.org)
-   [Scottish Ruby Conference](http://scottishrubyconference.com) (of
    course!)
-   [Barcelona Ruby Conference](http://baruco.org)
-   [Windy City Rails](http://windycityrails.org)
-   [Rocky Mountain Ruby](http://rockymtnruby.com)
-   [ArrrrCamp](http://arrrrcamp.be)
-   [RubyConf](http://twitter.com/rubyconf)

If you're attending any of these, be sure to hunt us down (via
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/freeagent/team/members) or just look
out for people in FreeAgent hoodies!) for a chat over a cup of tea. From
a teapot, naturally.
