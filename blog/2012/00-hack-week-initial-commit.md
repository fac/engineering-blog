Starting today we’re going to be trying something a little different in
our development team. For the entire week our project schedules are
being put on ice while all our engineers and designers (12 of them) are
being left to their own devices to hack on whatever they want, so long
as it’s FreeAgent-related.

[Hackathons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) like this are
nothing new in the software development world – Google offer 20% time,
Atlassian have [FedEx day](http://www.atlassian.com/fedex-day) . It’s no
surprise that developer-centric companies are doing this more
frequently. Hack days provide an opportunity for developers to get
properly [in the zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))
and push themselves to deliver something different; to learn and apply a
new technology; to deliver that project they’ve always wanted to kick
off but haven’t yet been able to prioritise; to take that crazy idea
they’ve been thinking about for ages and prove the concept with a
working prototype; to pair-up and *have fun*.

A lot of hackathons are
for an exhausting 24 or 48 hours, with long nights and lots of caffeine.
Our developers are more than welcome to stay late and hack (we’ll buy in
pizza – or more likely, [burritos](http://www.illegaljacks.co.uk/) – and
everyone can help themselves from our resident beer fridge), but we
don’t want to make that mandatory just to get stuff done. Instead, we’re
just making the hackathon a whole week long.

Hack Week is a prototype
itself. Expectations are high but of course [software projects often
fail](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/the-long-dismal-history-of-software-project-failure.html).
We’re cool with that though, because we know we’ll learn something
valuable from the experience and we’ll enjoy the ride!

I’ll be blogging
during the week about all the projects we’re undertaking and I'll post
again about what we accomplished on Friday.

Go FreeAgents!
