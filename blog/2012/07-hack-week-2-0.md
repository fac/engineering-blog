Back in January our design and engineering teams took part in our first
ever [Hack Week](/2012/01/09/hack-week-initial-commit/) and it was a
[resounding success](/2012/01/23/hack-week-round-up/).

A fair few of the Hack Week projects have made their way into FreeAgent
in one form or another and some, like App-wide Search, will be coming
your way soon. To me, what this shows is that by giving a development
team the freedom to hack on whatever they want, you can inspire real
creativity and achieve remarkable results. We’d be crazy not to explore
this further, so without further ado we’re kicking off Hack Week 2.0
this morning!

We had 12 people taking part in January. This time, fresh from the
Olympics with [a gold medal
spirit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19232685), we’re upping
the ante with Team FA which is now a mighty 24-strong.

There are a wide range of ideas floating around: command line tools for
improving our day-to-day dev workflow, 2-factor authentication, an API
client, new metrics dashboads, a mobile app and even a personal version
of FreeAgent. These are ambitious goals and success is not guaranteed
*or required*. What is guaranteed is that we’ll have a lot of fun, the
odd party and see some amazing work produced over the next five days.

On your marks, get set, HACK.
