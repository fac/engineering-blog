For the past three years we have invited interns to join our
Edinburgh-based Engineering team for the summer months between June and
September. Today we're officially opening the doors to the Class of
2013! Last year's interns developed one of FreeAgent's most requested
features, the [Online Payment
Portal](http://www.freeagent.com/central/online-invoice-payments), so
you'll get to work on an exciting project, not mundane work.

If you're a keen hacker and a CompSci (or similar) student at a UK university and
you want to do something amazing this summer, [take a look on our
website](http://www.freeagent.com/company/jobs/engineering-summer-interns)
for more information and please [get in
