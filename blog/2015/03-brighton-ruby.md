Here at FreeAgent Towers we've always been proud of the fact that Scotland held
[the UK's largest Ruby conference](http://scottishrubyconference.com) every year since 2008 (back when it was
called Scotland on Rails). The SRC organisers have hung up their conference boots for 2015 but fortunately
there are other regional Ruby conferences getting off the ground. One of these is [Brighton Ruby](http://brightonruby.com).

A couple of [FreeAgents](http://www.freeagent.com/company/about-us) were at the inaugural Brighton Ruby event in 2014
and we liked it so much that we've chosen to be the Gold sponsor of the 2015 event. It's on Monday 20th
July in the [Brighton Dome](http://brightondome.org/about/).

At only Â£100 per ticket we think it's fantastic value for money, and [there are still tickets left](https://ti.to/goodscary/brighton-ruby-conference-2015) so get in there quickly!

We hope to see you there!
