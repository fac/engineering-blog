We launched the first FreeAgent API [back in February 2008](http://www.freeagent.com/central/freeagent-update-release-fleurie). 
It served us well but 18 months ago [we launched our second-generation API](http://www.freeagent.com/central/api-2-is-here). 

The vast majority of [third party apps that integrate with FreeAgent](http://www.freeagent.com/developers/goodies) have
now migrated over to API 2.0, so we will be shutting down API 1.0 **by the end of 2013**.

We have [announced this](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/freeagent_api/v_HFjxoiFvA/Ek1UtCeBh5QJ) to our API community 
already, but we're now reaching out to our wider audience. If you're a developer using the FreeAgent 
API and you have yet to migrate your app over to API 2.0 then we recommend you prioritise this 
migration as soon as possible. 

If you need assistance in doing this, please drop by our [API Discussion Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/freeagent_api)
and we'll do our best to help.
