Back in October last year [I wrote about sunsetting our legacy API](http://engineering.freeagent.com/2013/10/22/sunsetting-api-1.0) 
at the end of 2013. We're now into the final stage of this decomissioning process. To make this as 
pain-free as possible, we're going to be running a series of API 1.0 blackouts over the next week. 
This means that on the following dates requests to API 1.0 will be rejected:

* 09 January 2014 14:00-16:00 GMT
* 13 January 2014 12:00-18:00 GMT
* 15 January 2014 09:00 GMT - 16 January 09:00 GMT

Assuming no issues are identified during these blackouts, the official end of life will follow on
**Monday 20 January 2014**.

If you have any issues or want to reach out to us about this, please use our 
[API Discussion Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/freeagent_api).
