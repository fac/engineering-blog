We uncovered an issue during [our previous blackout dates](http://engineering.freeagent.com/2014/01/06/api-1.0-blackout/). We have addressed this and will continue with a further 
series of API 1.0 blackouts this week. On the following dates requests to API 1.0 will be rejected:

* 28 January 2014 08:00 GMT - 29 January 2014 08:00 GMT
* 30 January 2014 08:00 GMT - 31 January 2014 08:00 GMT

Assuming no issues are identified during these blackouts, the official end of life will 
follow on **01 February 2014**.

If you have any issues or want to reach out to us about this, please use our 
[API Discussion Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/freeagent_api).
